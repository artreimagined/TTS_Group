While in quarantine I've been watching a lot of new shows. 
Here are some I recommend:

1. The Walking Dead
	I've tried to avoid watching this show but I could no longer resist. 

2. Itaewon Class
	A Korean drama that has plenty of episodes. 

3. Ru Paul's Drag Race
	Talent...

4. Vampire Diaries
	

5. Glee
	Watch at your own risk.

So this is me, Thomas Morf. I think the fact that I am writing this will be logged and documented by 
GitHub, but just in case, it me.

I love Ru Paul. I have a very specific love/hate relationship with the Walking Dead. I hear him say "Carl"
in my head sometimes. So that's a thing.

I have been addicted to Ozark! So goooood. But mostly retro video games and procrastinating homework.

Stick with what ya know, ya know?
